## **Risk Mitigation Strategies**

1. **Start small** - Implement POC with minimal features
2. **Iterative development** - Weekly releases
3. **User feedback loops** - Regular testing sessions
4. **Data migration strategy** - Start parallel tracking
5. **Training approach** - Phase-wise user training

This plan provides a structured approach to building your tyre management system, ensuring you deliver value at each phase while building toward a complete solution. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific section or create wireframes for any of these pages?
